## Description
A nice way to display CLI user / organization / repo info inspired in [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)

ghfetch is a CLI information tool written in `Python >= 3.5` that displays info about any user/org/repo you pass as argument.

Upon execution, the script displays on the terminal relevant information, like the profile picture, public repos, stars, followers, etc.

Additionally, in this project, we've used Github Actions to be able to create a new release each time we merge to main, thanks to this, the build for AUR is easier.

## Installation

**Arch Linux:**</br>
Use your favorite AUR helper, i.e:

## Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è
### Warn: `WARNING: The scripts ghfetch-pip is installed in '/home/USERNAME/.local/bin' which is not on PATH.`

If you are installing ghfetch using PIP, and you get a similar warning to this:</br>
![Path Warn preview](./path_warn_preview.png)

The solution is to add `export PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:$PATH` to your .bashrc, where `/home/user/.local/bin` would be the path that the warning is telling you, and reboot.

### Updating ghfetch using yay doesn't update it

This issue happens because the yay's cache is interfering with the update. The solution is to clear the cache of yay with `yay -Sc --aur`.
